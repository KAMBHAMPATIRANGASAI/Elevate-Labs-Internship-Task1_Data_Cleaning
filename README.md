# Task 1 â€“ Data Cleaning (Superstore Sales Dataset)

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship Task 1.  
I performed data cleaning on the **Superstore Sales Dataset** (4 years of global sales data).  
The dataset contains information on orders, customers, shipping, and sales performance.  

The goal of this task is to:
- Understand the raw dataset structure
- Identify and handle missing values
- Remove duplicates
- Standardize categorical values
- Convert date formats
- Save and provide a cleaned dataset ready for analysis

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Original dataset: [Superstore Sales Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting)
- Cleaned dataset is included in this repository.

## ðŸ”§ Cleaning Steps Performed
1. Removed 11 rows with missing `Postal Code`.
2. Removed duplicate rows.
3. Standardized categorical text columns (converted to lowercase, stripped spaces).
4. Converted `Order Date` and `Ship Date` to datetime format.
5. Renamed all columns to lowercase with underscores for consistency.
6. Saved final cleaned dataset as `cleaned_superstore_sales.csv`.
